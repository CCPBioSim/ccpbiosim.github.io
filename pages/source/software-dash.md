## Retired Software

These software packages have reached end of life and are no longer being actively maintained. The source will still be made available, and repositories archived.

| Application | Reason                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| [enlighten-chemshell-wrapper](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/enlighten-chemshell-wrapper) | Retired because it has been superseded by [chemsh-wrapper4enlighten](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/chemsh-wrapper4enlighten-plugin) |
| [FESetup](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/fesetup) | Retired because it has been superseded by [BioSimSpace](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/BioSimSpace) |
