# Welcome to CCPBioSim Developer Organisation

This GitHub organisation contains software, workshop material and many other types of repositories. These pages are aimed at developers, not users. They contain information about our development practices as well as details of which repositories are actively maintained and which are not.

This is currently a work in progress. Over time we wish to add things like roadmaps, dashboards, docs about coding etc etc.
